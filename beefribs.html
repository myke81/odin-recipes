        <h2>Discription</h2>
        
        <p>When you cook beef ribs in the slow cooker they come out tender, succulent, and so very flavorful.</p>
        
        <p>I cook them slowly for several hours, then baste them with the pan juices and briefly broil them to brown the fat.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <Ul>
            <li>Beef Back ribs</li>
            <li>Smoked salt</li>
        </Ul>
        
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p> Cut the rack into individual ribs. You can remove the thin membrane from the bone side of the ribs, but it's not mandatory, and I typically don't.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Now, mix the salt and spices and season the tops of the ribs, gently pressing to help the spices adhere. Add some water to the slow cooker pan, then layer the ribs in the pan. Cover and cook on LOW for 6 hours.
                
            </p></li>
            
            <li><p>Transfer the cooked ribs to a rimmed baking sheet. Baste them with the pan juices, then briefly broil to brown and crisp them up. That's it! Dinner is ready.</li><p>
